## AI Usage
I used AI to assist with a few small points. 

- Assisting with the calculations for the parts to calculate the days, hours, mins, secs. This was simply to speed up the process rather than self calculating the timings. 

- Assisting with formatting the JS after build. This was to tidy up any unneccesary code or to simplify anything that I had over complicated.
